## 4. Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of VentureConnect up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS recommended, e.g., v18.x or v20.x)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/venture-connect.git
    cd venture-connect
    ```

2.  **Clean up previous installs (Recommended for a fresh start):**
    This step ensures there are no lingering caches or old dependencies causing issues.
    ```bash
    # Stop your development server if running (Ctrl + C)
    npm cache clean --force # Clears npm's cache
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json # Deletes local dependencies and lock file
    # If you use yarn, use: rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

### Firebase Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Click "Add project" and follow the steps.

2.  **Add a Web App to your Project:**
    *   In your Firebase project, look for the `</>` (Web) icon to add a new web app.
    *   Register your app and copy the Firebase configuration object (it looks like `firebaseConfig = { apiKey: "...", ... }`).

3.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    *   **Authentication:** Navigate to "Authentication" -> "Get started". Enable "Email/Password" provider. (Optional: Enable Google Sign-in).
    *   **Firestore Database:** Navigate to "Firestore Database" -> "Create database". Choose **"Start in production mode"**. **Crucially, select `asia-south1 (Mumbai)` as your location.** This choice is permanent.
    *   **Firebase Storage:** (Optional, if you plan to allow image uploads) Navigate to "Storage" -> "Get started". Choose **"Start in production mode"** and ensure the location is also `asia-south1 (Mumbai)`.

4.  **Firestore Security Rules:**
    *   **WARNING:** The following rules are for **DEVELOPMENT ONLY** and are highly insecure. **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.**
    *   In the Firebase Console, go to "Firestore Database" -> "Rules" tab. Replace the content with:
        ```firestore
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Users collection rules
            match /users/{userId} {
              allow read: if request.auth != null; // Anyone logged in can read any user profile
              allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; // Only create own profile on signup
              allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; // Only update own profile
              allow delete: if false; // No deletion from client
            }

            // Job Posts collection rules
            match /job_posts/{jobId} {
              allow read: if request.auth != null; // Any logged-in user can read job posts
              allow create: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'entrepreneur'; // Only entrepreneurs can create
              // Allow update for the owner, and also for talent to update interestedUsers array
              allow update: if request.auth != null && (
                request.auth.uid == resource.data.postedBy || // Owner can update
                (request.auth.uid != resource.data.postedBy && request.resource.data.interestedUsers.size() > resource.data.interestedUsers.size() && request.resource.data.interestedUsers.hasAny([request.auth.uid])) // Talent can add themselves to interestedUsers
              );
              allow delete: if false; // No deletion from client
            }

            // Achievements collection rules
            match /achievements/{achievementId} {
              allow read: if request.auth != null; // Any logged-in user can read achievements
              allow create: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'entrepreneur'; // Only entrepreneurs can create
              allow update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.postedBy; // Only owner can update
              allow delete: if false; // No deletion from client
            }

            // Note: Add rules for meetups and journey_posts when you implement them
          }
        }
        ```
    *   Click **`Publish`**.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (same level as `package.json`). Populate it with your Firebase configuration details, ensuring each variable is prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for Create React App to recognize it.

```dotenv
# .env file
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID" # Optional, for Google Analytics


### Running the Application
Once everything is set up, you can start the development server:
npm start
# OR
yarn start
Use code with caution.

The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
